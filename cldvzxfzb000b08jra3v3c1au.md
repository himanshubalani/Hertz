Late last year, I took the opportunity to partake in the Fellowship and for the last 2 weeks, I've been attending their sessions and learning all about APIs.

# What is Keploy?

Keploy is an open-source end-to-end testing toolkit for developers that generates test cases and data mocks of API calls.

It converts API calls into test cases. Mocks/stubs are automatically generated with the actual requests/responses. It does so by recording your API calls and replaying them.

Keploy helps developers to focus on writing high-quality code, rather than spending time on repetitive testing tasks. This ultimately leads to faster and more efficient testing, resulting in higher-quality software.

# All the sessions, summarized

The whole fellowship was divided into 6 sessions and had 2-3 days in between sessions to do related taskwork. Here's a little breakdown for each session.

### Day 1 - Introduction to HTTPS and Basics of API

* On the first day, I was given an overview of the flow of the program.
    
* It was all theory describing the HTTPS Internet Protocol and why they're important.
    
* Covered the basics of API as well.
    
* Fellows were tasked with writing a blog on all our learnings during the session. I wrote this - [The Acronym that lets you see the internet safely](https://himanshubalani.hashnode.dev/the-acronym-that-lets-you-see-the-internet-safely)
    

### Day 2 - Theoretical Aspect of APIs

* This day covered the theoretical aspects of an API.
    
* It covered SOAP and REST APIs and their differences, The parts of an API, and the types of requests.
    
* Furthermore, we glanced over API security.
    
* Again we were tasked with writing a blog on all our learnings during the session. I wrote this - [The Ins and Outs of APIs](https://himanshubalani.hashnode.dev/the-ins-and-outs-of-apis)
    

### Day 3 - Making your first API call

* I learned about public APIs.
    
* I was shown how to use a public API on your website. [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) was used for this session. I learned about the kinds of responses we get with different API endpoints.
    
* We were tasked with creating a website using any public API for this session. [Here's what I came up with](https://github.com/himanshubalani/weather)
    

### Day 4 - Creating my API using Node.js

* I learned basics about HTML, CSS, and javascript.
    
* We built A **REST API** in Express and tested it using [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/).
    
* It was a hands-on session and great to create it in the session duration.
    
* We were tasked to make our Nodejs API - [I built this](https://github.com/himanshubalani/random-movie-quotes/)
    

### Day 5 - Using Go and Databases

* I learned the use of Go in creating applications with an API.
    
* A walkthrough was given for Go and I learned how to add Databases for the backend. We again used Postman for testing it.
    
* The task was to add a database to our previously built app.
    

### Day 6 - Keploy comes into the picture

* In the last session, we were taught how to integrate the typescript module using Keploy and
    
* We were taught about how Keploy works.
    
* The task for this session was what you're reading now.
    

## **My Experience**

The sessions were placed out fairly and there was a lot to learn in those two weeks. The DevRel Team with Animesh Pathak, Nishant Mishra, Hardik Kumar and Aniket Kumar were excellent in their respective sessions. They provided a basic understanding of topics and encouraged fellows to learn most of the stuff themselves. This allowed me to set goals for each task and helped me learn fast and better.

### Join the party!

If you're interested in learning about APIs and give 2 weeks to this then you should try it. **10/10 would recommend it.**
